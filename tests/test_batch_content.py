"""Guard test: after seed + climatology batch, the content is actually there.

Fails if the batch leaves **0** spots with climatology, if the batched spot's
``/season`` still 404s, or if ``/search/best-spots`` cannot rank it (flat/empty).
This is the regression guard for the "spots invisible / unsearchable" state — it
must not silently return.

Runs against the test database with a **fake** extraction client (the same
synthetic series the pipeline tests use), so no network is touched. Skips cleanly
when the test database is unreachable (see conftest).
