"""Score engine (Sprint 4) + the ranking ``Scorer`` seam (used by Sprint 5).

A rule-based, categorical evaluation (``gut`` / ``mäßig`` / ``nein``) parametrised
over three layers: ``scoring_params`` (global, versioned), spot ``editorial``, and
the rider ``profile`` (level). The *same* :func:`evaluate_conditions` runs both
live and over the climatology histogram, so seasonal and now-badges stay
consistent.

  evaluate_conditions      values -> {rating, reasons}        (core)
  apply_gates              hard pass/fail gates
  grade_magnitude          gut vs mäßig (with gust downgrade + level offsets)
  profile_thresholds       per-level threshold offsets
  score_live               now-badge via the live cache
  score_climatology_week   usable-hours share for a week
  score_climatology_curve  pct_usable[52] + good weeks
  describe_week            Stage-1 description (no gates)
  spot_confidence          hoch | mittel | niedrig

The ranking seam (`Scorer`, `default_scorer`, `distance_decay_d0`) lives in
`engine` and is consumed by `app.search`.
