"""Background ERA5 processing for the admin path.

Turns a *queued* ERA5 job into a derived climatology without waiting for the CLI
batch runner — used as a FastAPI ``BackgroundTask`` so the request returns
immediately. Reuses the tested per-spot pipeline (:func:`app.era5.batch.process_spot`)
and opens its own DB session (the request's session is closed by the time the
background task runs).
