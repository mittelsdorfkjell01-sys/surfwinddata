"""Open-axis time logic: resolve a time window and rank candidates over it.

Ranking over a window is **coverage-first**: the share of the window's weeks in
which a candidate is good (``pct_usable_hours ≥ week_good_threshold``), with mean
``pct_usable`` as the **intensity** tie-breaker. This is deliberately *not* a plain
average — a spot that is reliably good across many weeks should beat one that is
spectacular in a single week.
