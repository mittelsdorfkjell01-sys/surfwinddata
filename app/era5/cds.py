"""CDS request construction, the client seam, and job submission/polling.

The pipeline talks to Copernicus through a small :class:`CdsClient` protocol so
the network can be mocked in tests. Three operations are enough:

* ``submit(dataset, request)``  -> opaque request id
* ``poll(request_id)``          -> "queued" | "running" | "completed" | "failed"
* ``fetch_series(request_id)``  -> normalised hourly series (dict of arrays)

The real adapter (:func:`real_cds_client`) wraps ``cdsapi`` and is imported
lazily, so tests that inject a fake client never need ``cdsapi`` installed.
