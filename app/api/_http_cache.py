"""Shared Cache-Control for public, near-static GET endpoints.

These responses (the spot list/record, the region list/record) change only when
an admin edits data. Tagging them with ``s-maxage`` lets Vercel's edge CDN serve
them without invoking the Python function or waking Neon — so a first page open
(e.g. the landing's "aktuelle Top Spots") isn't blocked on a cold start.

``stale-while-revalidate`` hides the cold revalidation entirely: once the fresh
window lapses the edge returns the slightly stale copy instantly and refreshes in
the background, so no visitor ever waits on the cold function.

Only used on the public read path; live/forecast stay uncached (time-sensitive),
and the /admin* write endpoints never set this.
