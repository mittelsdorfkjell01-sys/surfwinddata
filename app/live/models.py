"""Regional weather-model selection for Open-Meteo.

Open-Meteo can serve several regional models; the high-resolution ones only
cover a bounded domain, so we pick the best regional model for the spot's
coordinates and fall back to ``best_match`` (Open-Meteo's own blend) elsewhere.

Domains are approximate bounding boxes for the published model coverage and are
intentionally simple; a spot's ``model_pref`` (when set) always wins.
