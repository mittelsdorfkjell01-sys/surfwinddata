"""Pure statistics for multi-model consensus + spread (Sprint 18, Phase 1).

No I/O and no dependencies, so this is unit-testable in isolation. Given the
per-model values of one variable at one timestep, the "spread" is the honest
uncertainty band: the **consensus** (median) is the headline estimate, and
min/max is the band. With <= 4 models min/max *is* the p0/p100 band, which is
the most interpretable form of the spread; ``n`` records how many models had
data so callers can degrade gracefully when coverage is thin.
